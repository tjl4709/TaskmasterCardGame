One cornhole board, a bean bag for each contestant, and some tape to mark off the board. Starting from the bottom of the board, after each round, move a horizontal line of tape up the board by about 3 inches until it reaches the hole.	Throw your bean bag onto the cornhole board. It must land on the board above the tape line, or sink through the hole.	Any contestant who misses the board or lands their bean bag below the tape line is out. The first contestant(s) out get 1 point and so on until the last contestant(s) in get points equal to the number of contestants.
